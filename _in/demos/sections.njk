      <h2>My love for Vienna and Strawberry Cashew Pancakes</h2>
      <p>posted by Olivia</p>

  <p>
    When I first arrived in Vienna, jet-lagged and <a href="#">wandering</a> without purpose, I stumbled into a quiet café near the Naschmarkt. It was the kind of place you hope to find when traveling—warm light, soft jazz, the smell of espresso and something sweet in the air. I ordered a plate of strawberry cashew pancakes, not expecting much, but the first bite stopped me cold.
  </p> 
  <p>
    The pancakes were perfectly golden, the strawberries <a href="https://www.country.com">slightly</a> warm and bursting with juice, and the cashews added a rich, buttery crunch that somehow made everything complete. It wasn’t just delicious—it was comforting, surprising, unforgettable. I sat by the window for an hour, watching trams glide past and feeling, for a rare moment, entirely present. Years later, I’ve forgotten the museums and palaces, but I still remember those pancakes. They tasted like the beginning of something good.

  <p>This is the reason I'm sharing my favourite recipe with you.</p>

    <h2>Strawberry Cashew Pancakes recipe</h2>
    <p>fruity freshness with nutty richness</p>
  </hgroup>

  <p>
    Pancakes are one of the oldest and most universal foods in human history. Archaeological evidence shows that prehistoric people made flat cakes from ground grains and water cooked on hot stones. From ancient Greece’s tēganitēs to French crêpes and Ethiopian injera, cultures worldwide have their own versions. In America, the modern fluffy pancake gained popularity in the 19th century with the rise of baking powder. Today, pancakes continue to evolve—like these strawberry cashew creations!

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

  <p>You don't need much for your perfect weekend breakfast or brunch!</p>

  <h4>Dry Ingredients:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (or whole wheat for a healthier version)</li>
    <li>2 tablesppon (tbsp) sugar (optional)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon (tsp) baking powder</li>
    <li>½ <abbr title="teaspoon">tsp</abbr> baking soda</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Wet Ingredients:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup milk (dairy or plant-based like almond or oat)</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>2 tbsp melted butter or neutral oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Mix-ins:</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>½ cup chopped fresh strawberries (plus extra for topping)</li>
    <li>¼ cup chopped roasted cashews (unsalted)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>

  <p>Now here's what you do with all those ingredients.</p>

  <h4>Prep the mix-ins</h4>
  <p>Start by gently washing the strawberries, then chop them into small, bite-sized pieces. If your cashews aren’t already chopped, roughly chop them into smaller chunks that will mix easily into the batter and provide a nice crunch without overwhelming the texture of the pancakes.</p>

  <h4>Make the batter</h4>
  <p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until they are evenly combined. In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter (or oil), and vanilla extract until smooth. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients and stir gently until the batter comes together—it's fine if a few small lumps remain, just avoid overmixing. Once the batter is mixed, carefully fold in the chopped strawberries and cashews so they're evenly distributed.</p>

  <h4>Cook the pancakes</h4>
  <p>Place a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease the surface with butter or oil. Once the pan is hot, pour about a quarter cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Let the pancakes cook until you see bubbles forming and popping on the surface, and the edges start to look set and slightly dry—this usually takes about two to three minutes. At that point, gently flip each pancake with a spatula and cook the other side for another one to two minutes, or until it's golden brown and cooked through.</p>

  <h4>Serve warm</h4>
  <p>Once all the pancakes are done, stack them on a plate and serve them warm. Top with extra chopped strawberries and cashews for added texture and flavor, and finish with a drizzle of maple syrup or a dollop of yogurt or whipped cream if you like. Enjoy them fresh off the pan for the best flavor and texture.</p>
